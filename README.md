# 🔌 Arduino & Tinkercad Circuit Projects

This repository contains a collection of circuit designs for educational purposes using **Arduino** and simulated with **Tinkercad Circuits**. All board layouts are provided as `.brd` files for reference and possible export to PCB if needed.

## 📁 Included Projects

1. **Button Buzzer**
   - A simple project demonstrating digital input and output.
   - Pressing a button activates a buzzer (sound alert).

2. **Photoresistor and LED**
   - Uses a light-dependent resistor (LDR) to control the brightness or activation of an LED.
   - Demonstrates analog input reading and conditional output.

3. **RGB Temperature Display**
   - Combines an RGB LED with a temperature sensor.
   - Changes color based on temperature values.

4. **Theft Alarm System**
   - Simulates a basic security system.
   - Uses inputs such as switches or sensors to trigger an alarm signal (e.g., buzzer or LED).
